  a. Given the sample size n is extremely large and the number of predictors p is small, I would expect a flexible learning method to outperform an inflexible method. Since n is large, there wouldn't be a need to make any assumptions about f(x), which is the first step in an inflexible (parametric) learning method; the very size of n would give structure to f(x) and allowing the flexible method (non-parametric) to learn from the data without restrictions would produce a better model of the data, with little risk of overfitting due to large n.

  b. Given the numbers of predictors p is extremely high and the number of observations n is small, I would expect an inflexible method to outperform a flexible one. A flexible method runs the risk of modeling the noise in the data, leading to overfitting and a high test error rate. If some assumptions are made about the structure of f(x) (i.e. using a parametric/inflexible method), the risk of overfitting is lowered.

  c. Given the relationship between the predictors and the response is highly non-linear, I would expect a flexible method to outperform an inflexible method since the true f(x) is non-linear, and flexible learning methods don't make any assumptions about the f(x).

  d. Given that the variance of the error terms is extremely high, I would expect an inflexible method to outperform a flexible one. Without making any assumptions about f(x) (inflexible/parametric), a flexible method has a relatively high probability of modeling the variance of the error terms as a part of f(x), whereas an inflexible method would reduce that probability, at least somewhat.

  a. Since the question is interested in understanding which factors affect CEO salary, which is a quantitative metric, this would be a regression scenario and the word "understanding" lends towards an interest in inference, as opposed to prediction. n = 500 (firms) and p = 3 (profit, number of employees and industry).

  b. Determining whether a new product will be a success or failure is a classification problem, and since the response is binary, logistic regression would be a good starting (Although logistic regression has the word regression in it, due to the output of f(x) being quantitative, the output is a probability of an observation being classified as a success, therefore the method is ultimately used for classification problems). n = 20 (similar products) and p = 13 (price charged for product, marketing budget, competition price and 10 other variables).
